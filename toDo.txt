1. Refactor code
- something with upgrades, don't like how they looks like
- unified table class for main tab? Should make code easier and then working with hover might be easier also
- get rid of functions for interval where possible, use event listener
2. Use framework? Make sure looks good on phone
3. make sure the game is working when web page is not in focus
4. Connect telegram methods
5. save/load
6. offline/idle income ; Also make some exiles go to sleep sometimes?
7. Improve current systems
- optimize timer intervals, probably change all to event listeners
- some cards have dynamic height, get rid of it
- Each second (tick) = 1 minute in game. Make it last a whole season. Or have some kinda real prestige system that is meaningful.
- make flipping tab better, somehow allow players to only flip one of the higher currencies, or set a floor/cap.
- upgrade to consume conquerer's orbs automatically.
- Communicate the map currency upgrades better.
- toggler to hide/show purchasable upgrades
- https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/gbntna/idle_exile_an_incremental_game_based_on_poe/fp8sd7u/ - investigate this comment, I guess sometimes exiles overlevel and break, not sure how that can happen without cheats though, 99->100 exp is huge.
- maybe some kinda global leaderboard, would need a server to be able to write to a .txt or DB tho.
- more early and end game upgrades/scaling.
- button that turns off all flips.
- add "live" market, where selling currency decrease it's price and increaase price for some other currency, and buying some currency makes it's price higher, while other currencies rates go down
- show how much currency each individual exile farmed
- add trading mini-game, where player can receive buying message which he should react to, and where he can get scammed
- add leagues with own mechanics, where might be unique mini-games
- buying divination stash tab allows currency to be farmed without exile - should it be changed?
- rework map upgrades like alch/scour/divstashtab works, by not just giving currency, but be attached to every exile farming and give currency there
- add analytics
- differ how upgrade flipping speed works - now it increases batch size? we can add upgrade to increase exactly speed
- leagues as separate mechanics
- make more links upgrades - starting at 1 links
8. Rebalance (game ticks, currency rates and economy, efficiecy, leveling)
- Change IIQ/Incubator upgrades, more expensive to start but price scales less.
- scale mirror upgrades (gives increased efficiency per)
- Make currency flipping upgrade price increase slower.
- probably nerf melvin efficiency.
